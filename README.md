# CC Simple Tree Harvester
A simple tree harvesting program for ComputerCraft. Plants and harvests a tree from a stationary position on a loop.

## Limitations
Only supports 1x1 trees without branches. Larger stumps or trees with branches will not be harvested correctly.

## Usage

 * Place a turtle facing a air block above a dirt block (which it can plant a sapling on)
 * Place saplings in the turtle's inventory.
 * Place coal, charcoal, or lava buckets in the turtle's inventory for fuel.
 * Run `treeharvester`.
